Testing for this project was a constant process, not just something done at the end. This was largely because we didn't have a very detailed plan or much documentation from the start. Because of that, I often had to test as I went, which led to a lot of stress and meant I sometimes had to completely rebuild parts of the website.

However, things got much easier and less stressful once I started breaking down tasks into smaller, more manageable steps. This helped me see the big picture better. Even though it was challenging, this ongoing testing helped me find and fix problems little by little. I focused mainly on making sure the website looked and worked great on all devices (responsive design) and that every feature did exactly what it was supposed to. I regularly used browser tools to quickly sort out any bugs, which really helped make the website strong and reliable in the end.

## BUGS

Many bugs were identified and successfully resolved throughout the development process as they arose.

**Known Bugs:**
- Poor Mobile Responsiveness: The website's layout and elements don't adapt well to smaller screens. This is a top priority for improvement.
- iOS/Safari Compatibility: Animations and videos currently do not function correctly when viewed on iOS devices or in the Safari browser.
- Broken Footer: The footer section is visually disrupted and requires a complete redesign to function and display properly.
- Contact Section Display Issues: On smaller screens, the contact section doesn't display correctly, with text appearing blurred at the bottom.
- Inconsistent Spacing & Layout Issues: Due to non-standardized spacing and an overall inconsistent website structure, applying margins often throws the layout off. This requires a more systematic approach to styling.
- Non-Standardized Typography: Fonts and text sizes vary across the website, leading to a less cohesive and professional look.
- Semantic HTML Errors: The HTML structure is not fully semantically correct, which can impact accessibility and maintainability.
- Mobile Image Margin: After the "About" section, the expanding image has an unintended white margin below it on mobile screens, which can be resolved with specific CSS media queries.

### Solved Bugs
- Typo in hero-section: A spelling error in the hero section's code has been corrected.
- Unwanted Video Margin: A black margin appearing below the hero video has been eliminated.
- Footer Horizontal Scrolling: An unintentional margin-right: 150px on the footer, which caused horizontal scrolling, has been removed.
